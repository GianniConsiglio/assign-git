• What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
	A gitignore is a file that removes files from being checked for changes and wont be added and pushed
	to working branches.
• What does fast-forward in Git mean?
	A fast-fast-forward means it gets the most updated changes in a main/dev branch and 
	updates the branch you merge to so that merging back up to main is less difficult.
• Why should you have different branches?
	You should have different working branches to split based on what you or your teammates are working on
	because you do not want to work on the same branch at the same time. This will reduce issues when 
	pushing new work to the repo.
• In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
	Only one repo should be needed for a project since the goal is to have the project come together as a whole.
	Merging seperate projects together will lose continuity since commits are in seperate repositories.
